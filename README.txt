This is a C++ implementation of a banking system. There is no regard to security issues, and database is stored as .txt file. In fact, there is an option to display all details of an account, which should not be accessible to everyone, or anyone. But who cares, I am just playing with C++ code.


Other problems to improve on:
1) login is a Bank function, but logout is an Account function, so it might be better to implement both under same class either as Bank or Account functions.
